# Rental Media System Final Project

## Overview
This project involves developing a comprehensive rental media system over two phases. Phase I focuses on the backend logic using Java, specifically creating classes and interfaces to manage media and customer data. Phase II expands on this by developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to interact with the system.

## Submission Deadlines
- **Phase I**: Monday, December 20, 2021, before midnight
- **Phase II**: Monday, January 10, 2022, before midnight

## Objectives
### Phase I
- Implement backend logic as specified in the project requirements from Chapters 1 to 13.
- Develop classes to handle media items and customer interactions.
- Implement functionalities such as adding, deleting, updating, and searching for media and customers.

### Phase II
- Create a GUI for the system using JavaFX, incorporating various layouts and controls.
- Enhance the customer and media classes with additional attributes.
- Implement functionalities for handling rentals, returns, and inventory management through the GUI.
